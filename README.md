Interview task for Xor.

This task was set for an interview with Xor in Bristol.

The challenge was: "We are using a database on a project for a scientific instrument; it stores the data from the instrument. The database is InfluxDB. What I'd like to see is a tool, in Windows, to browse a single table in the InfluxDB database. Let's say 10 columns and 50 rows. I'll leave it up to you how to program it, you can choose your favourite computer language, but the ideal solution for me would be C# and Visual Studio (because the rest of the project uses C#). This doesn't need to be anything complicated, but you may well feel inspired to impress with bells and whistles. The solution should include a CSV export of the data."

I have chosen to use Python as I do not know (at this time) C# and Python has several options for data analysis with lots of different libraries which may be useful.

The code can be run as a script (see requirements.txt for required packages) or you can run the .exe file found in the dist folder.
